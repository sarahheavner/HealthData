          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <br>
          <p>This interactive dataset explores data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau and Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System to determine the correlation between various combinations of health factors and age/income per state. 
             Below is a brief summary of each data combination that is available on the scatterplot. 
             The scatter plot will provide new data when a different axis label is selected and each state's data for the selected axes can be viewed by placing your mouse over the datapoint. 
          <p>
          <br>
          <h5>Poverty Vs. Lacking Healthcare</h5>
          <p>There is a correlation between the percentages of the state's population living in poverty and lacking healthcare.
             With the exception of a few outliers, there is a clear upward trend showing that as the percentage of the population living in poverty increases, so does the percentage lacking healthcare.</p>
          <br>
          <h5>Poverty Vs. Smokers</h5>
          <p>There is a slight positive correlation between the percentages of population living in poverty and smokers.
             Overall, there is an increase in the percentage of smokers as poverty increases. </p>
          <br>
          <h5>Poverty Vs. Obesity</h5>
          <p>There is also a positive correlation between poverty and obesity. 
             States with higher poverty percentages also have higher rates of obesity.</p>
          <br>
          <h5>Median Age Vs. Lacking Healthcare</h5>
          <p>There does appear to be some negative correlation between the median age of the state's population and percentage of the population that is lacking healthcare. 
             While most states are clustered around the middle of the graph both in median age as well as lacking healthcare, there is a downward trend showing that states with an older median population have lower precentages lacking healthcare.</p>
          <br>
          <h5> Median Age Vs. Smokers</h5>
          <p>There does not appear to be an obvious correlation between the median age and percentage of population that smokes.
             The majority of states are clustered between ages 35-40 and have smoker percentages ranging between 12-26.2%.
          </p>
          <br>
          <h5> Median Age Vs. Obesity</h5>
          <p>There does not appear to be a clear correlation between the median age and percentage of population that is obese.
             Most states fall between ages 35-40 and obesity rates between 21.3-35.9%. </p>
          <br>
          <h5> Median Income Vs. Lacking Healthcare</h5>
          <p>There is a negative correlation between median income and lacking healthcare. 
            As median income increases, the percentage of the population lacking health care decreases.</p>
          <br>
          <h5> Median Income Vs. Smokers</h5>
          <p>There is a clear negative correlation between median income and percentage of smokers. 
             States with the lowest median income have the highest rates of smokers.</p>
          <br>
          <h5> Median Income Vs. Obesity</h5>
          <p>There is a negative correlation between median income and obesity. 
             With the exception of some outliers, the states with the lowest median income have the highest rates of obesity.</p>
